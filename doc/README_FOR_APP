= Forgetmenot - CRM on a crash diet
Home page: http://www.openforgetmenot.com/


Forgetmenot is designed as an ultra-lightweight tool for tracking individual contacts, recording stuff about them so
that you only ever send them what they want to see. At present it is usable by Rails developers, and by end-users who
aren't too fussed about user interfaces ;-)

== Installation
  * Requires: Rails 1.2.6 or higher, PostgreSQL 8.x or MySQL 5.x
  * Get the code (!) - see http://github.com/thomasn/forgetmenot/tree/master or GettingStarted on the wiki
  * Set up databases forgetmenot_development, forgetmenot_production, forgetmenot_test
  * Check settings in config/database.yml (for MySQL, change adapter, see a standard Rails install for examples)
  * sudo gem install maruku - Maruku is used for Markdown support (drop 'sudo' on Windows machines)
  * rake db:migrate - create initial dev database
  * rake test - run all tests
  * ruby script/server -p 3333 - start the Mongrel server on port 3333

For deployment (Phusion Passenger is recommended of course, on nginx or Apache) see config/deploy.rb.

== Getting involved
If you are just getting started with UI changes, try hacking CSS
(public/stylesheets/forgetmenot.css) an/or adding some images to public/images (please make sure they can be used with
our MIT licensing, GPL and Creative Commons Share-Alike licenses don't allow this). The HTML for the app pages is
generated by app/views/common/* , you may want to add divs, classes etc. here.
