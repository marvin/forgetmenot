Other than a general face life the following changes have been made while 
updating FMN to Rails 2.2.1

~Ben

-- Major Changes --
1) Ferret & acts_as_ferret have been replaced by Sphinx & Ultrasphinx
2) Implemented will_paginate plugin

-- Minor Improvements --
1) All listings are now alphabetised, rather than chronological or ordered by id. 
See helper method order_by

-- Minor Bug Fixes --
1) This code has been removed from list.rhtml

<% if entity_class.hierarchical? %>
    <div>
      <%= get_hierarchy(entity_class) %>
    </div>
<% end %>-->

It appeared to break when listing groups.
